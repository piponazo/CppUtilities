/** @brief Solve given (non-integer) linear programming problem using the Simplex Algorithm (Simplex Method).

What we mean here by "linear programming problem" (or LP problem, for short) can be formulated as:

\f[\mbox{Maximize } c\cdot x\\
 \mbox{Subject to:}\\
 Ax\leq b\\
 x\geq 0\f]

Where \f$c\f$ is fixed `1`-by-`n` row-vector, \f$A\f$ is fixed `m`-by-`n` matrix, \f$b\f$ is fixed `m`-by-`1`
column vector and \f$x\f$ is an arbitrary `n`-by-`1` column vector, which satisfies the constraints.

Simplex algorithm is one of many algorithms that are designed to handle this sort of problems
efficiently. Although it is not optimal in theoretical sense (there exist algorithms that can solve
any problem written as above in polynomial time, while simplex method degenerates to exponential
time for some special cases), it is well-studied, easy to implement and is shown to work well for
real-life purposes.

The particular implementation is taken almost verbatim from **Introduction to Algorithms, third
edition** by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest and Clifford Stein. In particular, the
Bland's rule <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bland%27s_rule> is used to prevent cycling.

@param Func This row-vector corresponds to \f$c\f$ in the LP problem formulation (see above). It should
contain 32- or 64-bit floating point numbers. As a convenience, column-vector may be also submitted,
in the latter case it is understood to correspond to \f$c^T\f$.
@param Constr `m`-by-`n+1` matrix, whose rightmost column corresponds to \f$b\f$ in formulation above
and the remaining to \f$A\f$. It should containt 32- or 64-bit floating point numbers.
@param z The solution will be returned here as a column-vector - it corresponds to \f$c\f$ in the
formulation above. It will contain 64-bit floating point numbers.
@return One of cv::SolveLPResult
